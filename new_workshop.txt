                    <p> 
                        
        Would your students have fun learning about buoyancy by
        getting their hands wet with some fun challenges? 
        This workshop will help students learn how boats work
        through a series of activities that cover buoyancy 
        and sail design through iterative building and hands-on group work. 
        Over the course of this workshop, students will build their own 
        cardboard boat from scratch and see how much “treasure” it can hold!
        <br>
        Several of the described activities can take place concurrently, allowing students to choose with which stations
        they engage. A culminating large cardboard boat building activity can be contracted or 
        expanded as time allows.                   
                    </p>

                    <h2>Materials + Preparation</h2>
                    <p> 
                        The <a href="../downloads/float_boatGuide.pdf">Teacher's Guide </a> provides set-up instructions 
                    for multiple boat-related hands-on activites.
                    Most of the activities use common materials such as duct tape, tin foil, plastic bins, and discarded cardboard. 
                    One of the activities uses 3D-printed 
                    shapes as a way to explore buoyancy, but lower-fi alternatives can be used to a similar effect.
