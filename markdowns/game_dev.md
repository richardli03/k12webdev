# Description 
Do your students like video games? Do you want an interactive activity that will get your kids moving, while also teaching them about the coordinate grid? An activity that allows them to explore their creativity while learning the fundamental concepts of programming? This activity will have the students learning how to program a game in Scratch using custom functions and the skills they learn in a preceding interactive activity to understand the basics of programming. 

# Materials
 The Teacher's Guide provides set-up instructions for the human video game activity moving around a coordinate grid set up on the floor and all of the information you need to get games up and running in Scratch. It also includes tips for facilitating this workshop and possible game extensions.

Students will need access to free Scratch accounts on a laptop/Chromebook/desktop.
