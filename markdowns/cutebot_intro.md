# Description 
This module serves as an introduction to both robotics and micro bits. The kids will start with programming the microbit to light up the leds in a pattern they want. That will show them how to program the micro bit and then they will use those skills to program the cutebot to drive around and light up. The programming of the robot is more open ended so the kids can get the robot to do whatever they want and can help each other figure out new things. We had them present what their robots could do at the end of the class time.

This module serves as an introduction to robotics with a cutebot after they have already learned about and worked with Micro Bits. It is largely the same as the module above except that it does not walk them through programming the microbit because this one assumes they have worked with the microbit before.
