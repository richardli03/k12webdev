# Description 
Would your students have fun learning about buoyancy by getting their hands wet with some fun challenges? This workshop will help students learn how boats work through a series of activities that cover buoyancy and sail design through iterative building and hands-on group work. Over the course of this workshop, students will build their own cardboard boat from scratch and see how much “treasure” it can hold!

Several of the described activities can take place concurrently, allowing students to choose with which stations they engage. A culminating large cardboard boat building activity can be contracted or expanded as time allows.

# Materials
The Teacher's Guide provides set-up instructions for multiple boat-related hands-on activites. Most of the activities use common materials such as duct tape, tin foil, plastic bins, and discarded cardboard. One of the activities uses 3D-printed shapes as a way to explore buoyancy, but lower-fi alternatives can be used to a similar effect.
