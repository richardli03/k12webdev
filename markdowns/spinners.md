# Description 
Say the words “fidget spinner” to your class, and you’re almost certain to get an impressive reaction. Piggybacking off this, we’ve built a workshop that will allow your kids to experimentally develop an understanding and intuition regarding friction and angular momentum. They’ll learn about the iterative design process, personalize their creations, and of course, have a spin-tastic time!


# Materials
The Teacher's Guide (pdf) provides set-up instructions for enabling students to build spinners of increasing quality and complexity. Some of the versions are optimized through the use of a laser cutter or Cricket, but scissors and cereal box cardboard can be used.
