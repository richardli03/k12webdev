# Description 
Would your students enjoy bravely rescuing dragon eggs from a ring of fire - while learning how to think creatively to solve real-world problems like engineers do? Engineering doesn’t have to be so scary. This series of design challenges takes students through an iterative, hands-on design-build-test cycle, where they work with limited resources to create simple tools which help them collaborate to accomplish tangible lively challenges embedded in an exciting, motivating narrative. We tasked students with rescuing and caring for “baby dragons”: delivering dragon eggs from their nest, and then feeding and brushing the teeth of the newly-hatched baby dragons.

Educators can readily change the theme to fit their educational context and their available materials. Educators are also encouraged to design alternative challenges which similarly emphasize the core learning principles of creatively using materials and working together to solve hands-on problems in an iterative design-build-test process. 

# Materials
The Teacher's Guide provides set-up instructions for preparing your space for a variety of Dragon Challenges. The challenges can be modified based on students' interests and supplies on hand. A varity of common office/household materials are suggested in the Teacher's Guide
