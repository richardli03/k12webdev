										In this workshop, students use art as a way to increase understanding of
										mathematical concepts. Students are first guided through activities that
										look at everyday objects and break them down into simple shapes. Then,
										students are introduced to a free online graphing program, Desmos, as a
										way to review graphing lines and circles. Finally, students use Desmos
										in an exploratory lesson aimed to increase relatedness around graphing
										circles and using inequalities. The exercise walks students through
										step-by-step equations to graph the face of a Bear, tying each equation
										back to a distinct part of the Bear, and it invites students to apply
										their own creative extensions, further solidifying their knowledge of circles and inequalities.
