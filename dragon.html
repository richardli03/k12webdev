            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p> Would your students enjoy bravely rescuing dragon eggs from a ring of fire
                - while learning how to think creatively to solve real-world problems like engineers do? 
                Engineering doesn’t have to be so scary. This series of design challenges takes students 
                through an iterative, hands-on design-build-test cycle, where they work with limited resources
                 to create simple tools which help them collaborate to accomplish tangible lively challenges 
                 embedded in an exciting, motivating narrative. We tasked students with rescuing and caring for “baby dragons”: 
                 delivering dragon eggs from their nest, and then feeding and brushing 
                 the teeth of the newly-hatched baby dragons. 
                             
                   </p>
                   <p>
                      Educators can readily change the theme to fit their
                        educational context and their available materials.  Educators are also
                        encouraged to design alternative challenges which similarly
                        emphasize the core learning principles of creatively using materials
                        and working together to solve hands-on problems in an iterative design-build-test process.

                   </p>
           

            <h2>Materials + Preparation</h2>
            <p> 
                The <a href="downloads/dragonGuide.pdf">Teacher's Guide </a> provides set-up instructions for preparing your space for a variety of Dragon Challenges.
              The challenges can be modified based on students' interests and supplies on hand.  A varity of common office/household materials
              are suggested in the Teacher's Guide.
