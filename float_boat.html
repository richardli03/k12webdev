            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p> Would your students have fun learning about buoyancy by
                getting their hands wet with some fun challenges? 
                This workshop will help students learn how boats work
                 through a series of activities that cover buoyancy 
                 and sail design through iterative building and hands-on group work. 
                 Over the course of this workshop, students will build their own 
                 cardboard boat from scratch and see how much “treasure” it can hold!

                                            
                   </p>
                   <p>
                   Several of the described activities can take place concurrently, allowing students to choose with which stations
                   they engage. A culminating large cardboard boat building activity can be contracted or 
                   expanded as time allows.
               

                   </p>

            <h2>Materials + Preparation</h2>
            <p> 
              The <a href="downloads/boatGuide.pdf">Teacher's Guide </a> provides set-up instructions 
               for multiple boat-related hands-on activites.
            Most of the activities use common materials such as duct tape, tin foil, plastic bins, and discarded cardboard. 
            One of the activities uses 3D-printed 
            shapes as a way to explore buoyancy, but lower-fi alternatives can be used to a similar effect.
        </p>
