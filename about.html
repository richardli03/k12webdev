			<h1 class=""> About Us </h1>
			<div class="adjust-line-height">

			<p>We are a collection of Olin College students and faculty dedicated to broadening access to STEM/STEAM for pre-college learners.  
				One group is from a course called Mathematics and Engineering for Everyone 
				designed by <a href="https://www.olin.edu/bios/sarah-s-adams" target="_blank">Professor Sarah Spence Adams</a> and 
				first offered in 2021.  The second group is from Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship (ADE), an Olin capstone program.  
				The ADE Community Development track has included a focus on K-12 STEAM education through
				 its Shifting Rhythms program which has been advised by <a href="https://www.olin.edu/bios/kofi-taha" target="_blank">Professor Kofi Taha </a> since 2014. 
				Each group has different goals and methods, but both believe that broadening access 
				to STEM is a social justice issue for many reasons, 
				including for the paths STEM can provide towards socio-economic mobility.
