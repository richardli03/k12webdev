		<h2> About Us </h2>
		<p>Olin College was founded to be an important and constant contributor to the advancement of engineering
			education in America and throughout the world. The workshops on this page were developed in a new Olin
			course dedicated to broadening access to STEM materials and mentors.

			Under the guidance of Professor Sarah Spence Adams, Olin students worked remotely with youth at four
			schools/community organizations across three states, delivering workshops and forming human connections
			during the isolating days of the COVID-19 pandemic. These workshop materials, along with Teacher’s Guides,
			are now available to the public. This website was created by Mia Skaggs, a student in the course, to
			encourage further use of these materials.

			Email sarah.adams@olin.edu with any questions, comments, or suggestions, and we will get back to you as soon
			as we can!
