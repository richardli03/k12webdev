    After years of running one-off K12 outreach events, 
    <a href="https://www.olin.edu/bios/sarah-s-adams" target="_blank">Professor Sarah Spence Adams</a> decided to create a course, 
    Mathematics and Engineering for Everyone, wherein Olin students
    design, develop, and deploy STEM workshops with younger partner learners in a nearby city. 
</p>
    
    The community impact goal of this course is to increase interest, 
     confidence, and sense of belonging in STEM among kids, with an emphasis 
     on kids who may not otherwise have access to STEM materials & mentors.
                The learning goals for Olin students include practicing the user-centered 
                engineering design process and learning about and implementing research-backed
                 pedagogies and educationaldesign principles, while also improving their communicate and collaboration
                 skills.  
               </p>  
                 


                
                 <p>
                    Materials created by students in Mathematics and Engineering 
                    for Everyone are tagged with Engineering for Everyone (E4E) in the <a href="index.html">Gallery</a>.
                                        All materials are free to use under the
