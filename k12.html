    After years of running one-off K12 outreach events, 
    Professor Sarah Spence Adams decided to create a course, 
    Mathematics and Engineering for Everyone, wherein Olin students
    design, develop, and deploy STEM workshops with partner learners. 
     The community impact goal of this course is to increase interest, 
     confidence, and sense of belonging in STEM among kids, with an emphasis 
     on kids who may not otherwise have access to STEM materials & mentors.
</p>
                  
               <p>
                The learning goals for Olin students include practicing the user-centered 
                engineering design process, learning about and implementing research-backed
                 pedagogies and educational design principles, and developing the following 
                  Olin Learning Outcomes: Prioritize Doing Good in the World, Communicate Effectively,
                   Collaborate Successfully, Design and Implement Processes to Achieve Desired Outcomes, 
                   Develop and Apply Creativity, Develop Personal and Professional Identity.   
               </p>  
                 


                
                 <p>
                    Materials created by students in Mathematics and Engineering 
                    for Everyone are tagged with E4E and can be viewed here
