This website is for current Olin Students and k-12 teachers to use. It houses workshops/modules developed by Olin students in partnerships with teachers and students.

This website was created in summer 2023 mainly by Richard Li, Meredith Alley, and Declan Ketchum 

## What is here? 

## How to Add a work shop? 
To add a workshop you will have to add a tile in the gallery/index page, create a workshop page, and attach a teacher guide or other pdf form of your workshop. 

There are 2 ways to add a tile to the gallery/index: 
- you can use the generator python script to take a spreadsheet and create all the tiles you need - this is expeshally helpful if you have multiple workshops to add at once or if you are chaning information on many workshops. 
- Or you can copy one of the existing tile code blocks and change the tile, discription, tags, ect

When you add a tile make sure that you have the correct links to the workshop page, thumbnail image, and download file!

You will need to upload an image for your new workshop. To stay in line with the current orginization system you should go into img folder and create a new folder with the title of your workshop. add whatever image you want as the thumbnail and title it: workshop_name_1.png or whatever image type. Insure that the aspect ratio of your image is 3:2. This needs to be done on the original image so that the images don't get squished awkwardly by some css size inforcement. 

By this point you should have a tile on the gallery/index page! Yay!

Now you need to make a workshop page:
Make a copy of one of the existing pages blah blah blah need to add more here onece these are working better and we decide where they should live!
