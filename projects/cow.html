            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p> Math is everywhere - especially in video games! We’ll take a look at how to make predictions 
                and strategic choices in a super simple phone game called Cow Evolution.

                In part one, we’ll recognize that this game is fundamentally based off 
                exponentials and use that observation to predict how long it takes to 
                beat the game in its most simplistic form. We’ll also gain intuition for
                 just how fast exponential functions grow.
                
                In part two, we’ll talk about modeling. What parts of the game
                 can we extrapolate away and what parts do we need to keep to 
                 answer questions about game strategy?
                
                Students will see how to simplify a complex system to a 
                solvable problem, and understand how to transfer the ideas to 
                the video games they know and love.

                        This workshop works well with the workshops Carnival Games and 
                        Games with a 100% Win Strategy.

            <p>
                The                     <a href="../downloads/cowGuide.pdf">Teacher's Guide</a>
                provides suggestions for running the workshop and teaching the exponentials hidden inside this simple but fun game.
                The  <a href="../downloads/cowSlides.pdf">Slides</a> can be adapted
                for online or classroom use. If teaching online,
                students would require internet connected devices. In person, a calculator could be helpful. 


            </p>
            
        <p> 
            Students will need access to the internet on a laptop/Chromebook/desktop. 
            A phone can work, but 
            the examples and games are easier to see and play on a larger screen.
