            <h2>Description</h2> 
            
           
            <p> 
                Would your students be excited about interacting with a roaring blast
                 of wind? In this workshop, students will learn about air resistance while 
building hovercrafts that sink, float, or fly out of the top of the 
wind tunnel! Theyâ€™ll practice being engineers by experimenting with 
weights and surface area to build their hovercrafts, as well as 
recording their variables, graphing their results, and making hypotheses (guesses). 

                                                </p>

            <h2>Materials + Preparation</h2>
            <p> 
                This workshop requires a wind tunnel, which can be made with a strong fan, cardboard, and duct tape.  
                The                     <a href="../downloads/windGuide.pdf">Teacher's Guide</a>
                discusses optimal materials, including instructions to 3D-print parts for the 
                hovercraft experimentation.  Lower-fi materials can be used, however.
            </p>
                <p>
              This workshop has been wildly popular with students at a variety of locations, ranging 
              from elementary school through high school. For younger elementary students,
              we suggest framing the challenge as iterating on hovercraft designs until they get a version that sinks, a version
              that floats, and a version that sinks. For older high school students, we recommend focusing on the hardest challenge,
              which is to create a hovercraft that floats. To increase difficulty, limit the number of trials to achieve
              the elusive float!
